 # University of Waterloo: CS456 PeerToPeerNetwork
### About:
This zip file contains the scripts for executing the code. In the code folder there's all the code assignment 3.

### Compilation:
Since the programs are written in python, there is no need of makefile for compiling and executing the code.

### Execution:
**_To execute use the provided scripts_** tracker.sh **_and_** peer.sh. After giving the scripts permission
to execute simply type **./tracker.sh** for executing the tracker and
**./peer.sh <addressTracker> <portTracker> <minTimeinSeconds>** for executing the peer

### Additional notes
The code for the multiple threads and its pools was based from different online sources. As far as I've been able to test it works.\
Connecting any number of peers either from the same machine or from other machines will work.
